# Ribbreakers United

**We Break Ribs to Save Lives**

Ribbreakers United is a community-driven initiative to normalize life-saving chest compressions and overcome bystander hesitation during cardiac emergencies. This repository contains the source code for our website.

## Our Mission

We're uniting the CPR community worldwide to ensure everyone has the skills and confidence to act when seconds matter. Our goals include:

- **Normalize Rib-Breaking**: Transform rib fractures from a feared outcome into a point of pride—a sign of proper, life-saving CPR technique
- **Universal Training Access**: Advocate for government-sponsored free CPR/AED/First Aid training accessible to everyone 13 and older
- **Strengthen Good Samaritan Protections**: Educate the public about legal protections that shield responders from liability
- **Institutional Support**: Push for mandates, tax incentives, and policies that keep CPR certifications fresh
